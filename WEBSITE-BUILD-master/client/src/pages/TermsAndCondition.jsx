                <h2>Payments
                </h2>
                <p>Trip It Today, through our payment partner, Trip It Payments, offers an online payment service
                    (the “Payment System”) for processing payments to Property Owners via PayPal, credit card,
                    debit card, or other accepted payment methods. If you choose to use a third-party account or
                    card for your transactions, you remain subject to these Terms of Service, and the third-party
                    account holder or cardholder will not gain any rights under these Terms. We reserve the right to
                    alter or discontinue the Payment System at any time, without prior notice, at our discretion.
                    When utilizing a third-party payment processor like PayPal, please be aware that you may be
                    subject to their specific terms, conditions, and fees, as well as their privacy practices. We advise
                    you to review these details before using their services.
                </p>
                <h2>Mandatory Use of Payment System
                </h2>
                <p>When an Owner has activated online Booking for their Property Listing, you and the Owner are
                    required to use the Payment System exclusively for all payments related to the Booking.
                    Non-compliance with this requirement will be considered a breach of these Traveler Terms of
                    Service. Wire transfers for Booking payments are strictly prohibited and will also be deemed a
                    violation of these Terms.

                </p>
                <h2>Booking and Rental Agreements
                </h2>
                <p>By booking through the Payment System, you agree to the Rental Agreement with the Owner
                    (including the Owner’s cancellation policy as specified in the Property Listing), these Traveler
                    Terms of Service (including the Chargeback Policy in Section 9), and our Privacy Policy. </p>
                <p>Should
                    you dispute a legitimate charge contrary to our Chargeback Policy, Trip It Today or Trip It
                    Payments may seek to recover any fraudulently reversed charges from you. Refer to Section 9
                    for the full Chargeback Policy.
                </p>
                <h2>Payment Processing and Assistance
                </h2>
                <p>Although the Payment System facilitates transactions, neither Trip It Today nor Trip It Payments
                    are responsible for the payment solutions themselves. This includes any decisions made by
                    PayPal or other payment providers to decline your payment based on their risk assessments.
                </p>
                <p>For payment-related assistance, please contact PayPal, your bank, or your payment card issuer
                    directly.
                </p>
                <h2>Payment Collection and Management
                </h2>
                <p>rip It Today and Trip It Payments are not parties to the Rental Agreement between you and the
                    Owner. However, we act as the Owner's payment collection agent solely for accepting payments
                    from you on behalf of the Owner. Upon receiving your payment, your obligation to the Owner is
                    considered fulfilled, and we or Trip It Payments will transfer the payment (less applicable fees)
                    to the Owner. Should we fail to remit the payment, the Owner's recourse is limited to Trip It
                    Today or Trip It Payments.
                </p>
                <h2>Billing Information and Authorizations
                </h2>
                <p>For a Booking, you will need to provide standard billing details such as name, billing address,
                    and payment method. You authorize Trip It Today or Trip It Payments to charge your payment
                    method for the confirmed Booking and any potential damages at the Property. We may also
                    store your payment information and charge your payment method as described in these
                    Traveler Terms of Service. Any updates to your payment method’s account details should be
                    made through your bank.
                </p>
                <h2>Receipts and Collection Efforts
                </h2>
                <p>Upon a successful payment, you will receive a confirmation email detailing your Booking. If Trip
                    It Today or Trip It Payments are unable to collect amounts owed, we may initiate collection
                    efforts, including electronic or phone communication, to recover these amounts. You consent to
                    this mode of communication.
                </p>
                <h2>Security Deposits
                </h2>
                <p>Owners may require security deposits, as outlined in their Property Listings. If a deposit is
                    needed, Trip It Today or Trip It Payments may pre-authorize your payment card for this amount
                    before your check-in. This deposit may be used to cover any damage or additional charges
                    incurred during your stay.
                </p>
                <h2>Unauthorized Overstaying
                </h2>
                <p>A Booking grants you a limited license to use the Property. If you stay beyond the specified
                    checkout time without the Owner's consent, you will be liable for additional charges at double
                    the nightly rate, plus any legal costs incurred to enforce this term. We and Trip It Payments are
                    authorized to charge any payment method on file for such overstaying fees.
                </p>
                <h2>Scheduled Payments
                </h2>
                <p>If your Booking includes Scheduled Payments, you authorize Trip It Today or Trip It Payments to
                    charge your card according to the provided schedule. You may cancel a Scheduled Payment by
                    notifying us at least three business days before the payment date. Written confirmation may be
                    required.
                </p>
                <h2>Cancellations and Refunds
                </h2>
                <p>To cancel a confirmed Booking made through the Site, follow the Owner’s cancellation policy as
                    detailed in the Property Listing. Cancellations must be processed through the “Manage Your
                    Booking” section of the Site. Refunds for cancellations will be issued within a commercially
                    reasonable timeframe. If an Owner cancels, we will process a refund for the total Booking fee.
                </p>
                <p>Cancellations made within 24 hours of Booking, with at least 60 days before the stay begins, will
                    receive a full refund.
                </p>
                <h2>Indemnification
                </h2>
                <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Trip It Today and its affiliates against any claims or
                    damages arising from your use of the Payment System, including claims from Owners, PayPal,
                    or other payment providers.
                </p>
                <h2>Chargeback Policy
                </h2>
                <p>By making a payment through the Payment System, you agree to the Rental Agreement with
                    the Owner, these Traveler Terms of Service, and the Chargeback Policy outlined in Section 9.
                </p>
                <p>Chargebacks occur when your payment card provider demands a refund for a disputed
                    transaction. If you dispute a legitimate charge without merit, Trip It Today may seek to recover
                    any reversed charges from you. We adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards chargeback fraud
                    and may employ collection agencies to recover funds.
                </p>
                <h2>Payment Protection Policy
                </h2>
                <p>Our Payment Protection Policy offers reimbursement to Travelers who use the Payment
                    System. To be eligible, your claim must fall within Covered Circumstances, you must have used
                    the Payment System for the rental, and you must adhere to all policy requirements. The
                    maximum reimbursement is the lesser of the total amount paid or USD $10,000/£7,000/€7,000.
                </p>
                <p>Reimbursement is not available if you’ve requested a chargeback or dispute through other
                    channels.
                </p>
                <h2>Indemnification
                </h2>
                <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Trip It Today and its affiliates from any
                    claims arising out of your use of the Site, including your use of Property Listings, Third-Party
                    Content, or any breach of these Terms.
                </p>
                <h2>Prohibited Activities
                </h2>

                    fraudulent bookings, or bypass any access restrictions. Prohibited actions include scraping
                    content, disrupting Site performance, or posting misleading reviews.
                </p>
